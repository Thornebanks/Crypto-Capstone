# Crypto-Capstone

The web application is called Gemimine. 
I am an avid crypto and stocks trader, so I thought why use someones elses app when I can make my own.
With my current skill level I was able to make this app work.


API refrences:  https://api.nomics.com/
                https://alpha-vantage.p.rapidapi.com/query
                https://crypto-news-live.p.rapidapi.com/news/coindesk
                For all of them a key is required, but they are all free API

Features
This application allows a user to search and keep track of current prices, news and exchange rate of your favorite cryptocurrency.
