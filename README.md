# Crypto-Capstone

The web application is called Gemimine. 
I am an avid crypto and stocks trader, so I thought why use someones elses app when I can make my own.
With my current skill level I was able to make this app work.


API refrences:  https://api.nomics.com/
                https://alpha-vantage.p.rapidapi.com/query
                https://crypto-news-live.p.rapidapi.com/news/coindesk
                For all of them a key is required, but they are all free API

Features
This application allows a user to search and keep track of current prices, news and exchange rate of your favorite cryptocurrency.


Alternatively, if you would like to test out the application, or have some ideas that can be implimented, you can contact me for details:

Setup
Run npm i or npm install in client folder to install project dependencies

Client-Side
Run npm start in the client folder to start the app

I was working on server side, but due to the API not supporting CORS I couldnt.
The project has still few things to be implimented in which certain things will move to server side.
